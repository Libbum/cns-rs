# cns-rs

A clean numerical simulation (CNS) library.

## Release Information

Early development state, not ready for use.

## Research

Initially proposed in [On the reliability of computed chaotic solutions of non-linear differential equations](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0870.2009.00402.x) and subsequent work by 廖世俊.

Most notable recent work [On the clean numerical simulation (CNS) of chaotic dynamic systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(16)60785-0) identifies more than [600 new periodic orbits of the three-body problem](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11433-017-9078-5).
